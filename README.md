# Predicting CO2 Emissions of Vehicles Using Telematics Data

## Description
This project involves predicting CO2 emissions from vehicles by analyzing telematics data, which includes various vehicle attributes such as model, transmission type, and emissions data. The project aims to develop a reliable model that can estimate CO2 emissions based on these attributes, contributing to more efficient vehicle emissions management.

## Implementation

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- The dataset, containing vehicle-related information, is loaded and explored using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- Initial data analysis includes inspecting the data types, identifying missing values, and getting a general overview of the dataset structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Missing values are handled appropriately to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
- Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing data, including encoding categorical variables like transmission type.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA is performed using visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the relationships between variables and CO2 emissions.
- Key insights from the EDA guide the selection of features for the machine learning model.

### 4. Model Development
- Various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, are implemented to predict CO2 emissions.
- Models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to determine their performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Selection
- The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and further fine-tuned for better accuracy.
- Visualization of model performance, such as residual plots and feature importance charts, is conducted.
